# tfq-openAI-research
- Quantum reinforcement learning research
- Use of Variational Circuits on deep reinforcement learning algorithm (DQN) with OpenAI gym environments (cartpole and blackjack)
- Quantum Circuits implemented using Cirq and Tensorflow Quantum
- NOTE: Most of the code is taken from repository: https://github.com/lockwo/quantum_computation
- Associated paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07524.pdf
- "Fusion" and some of the "new" files take ideas from this tutorial: https://github.com/sjerbi/quantum/blob/master/docs/tutorials/quantum_reinforcement_learning.ipynb
